TODO 
- find out if (when taking 20% of random proteins) they ever cluster up soo much.
- do they ever get such high scores for david?



TODO for quan (ALL DONE!)
- p value for edge internalness random permutation test
- funtional annotation for gene expression?


Notes from meeting with quan:

- use all HPA data, not only reliable, just to see what comes out
- for edge internalness, don't consider specific-specific edges that are never expressed together (0 in the plot before)
- random expectation for edge expression by tissue
